Get active endpoints
- Send "Active Endpoints Request" to each node discovered.

For each endpoint:
- Send "Simple Descriptor" request to get details such as input and output clusters


Bind devices

- Send "Binding Request" to source (output) endpoint to send messages to destination (input) endpoint.


Configure reporting

- send "Configure Reporting" request to node|endpoint|cluster|attributeId

- send "Bind Request" to the cluster to set the destination for reporting.

Messages will be delivered to the destination of bindings
